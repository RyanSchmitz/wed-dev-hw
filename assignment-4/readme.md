## What is Alt Text?...
Alt text is an attribute in which whomever coding a website describes an image/graphic or visual of some nature. The purpose of alt text is to provide those that are visually impaired with a proper and detailed description of what is appearing on their screen.

## Forms I have seen...
Every time I am surfing the web, I encounter many different types of form elements. They range anywhere from the Youtube search bar to photo uploading platforms. Forms have a number of different uses. They allow users to easily access an entire database of information, submission abilities, and uploading as well.

## Work Cycle...
This week I had to split my work in two parts, as there just wasn't enough time to complete the tasks in one sitting. I noticed that after I had completed the website, there were some mistakes. I thankfully pushed past my inclination to give up, and I toyed with the html until everything looked okay. It was helpful to be able to tweak different elements until I achieved the outcome I was looking for.
