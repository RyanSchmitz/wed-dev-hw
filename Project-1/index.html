              <pre>
        In visions of the dark night<br />
        I have dreamed of joy departed-<br />
        But a waking dream of life and light<br />
        Hath left me broken-hearted.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
            Ah! what is not a dream by day<br />
            To him whose eyes are cast<br />
            On things around him with a ray<br />
            Turned back upon the past?<br />
  <br />                                             <img src="./images/oldtree.jpg">
  <br />
            That holy dream- that holy dream,<br />
            While all the world were chiding,<br />
            Hath cheered me as a lovely beam<br />
            A lonely spirit guiding.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
        What though that light, thro' storm and night,<br />
        So trembled from afar-<br />
        What could there be more purely bright<br />
        In Truth's day-star?<br />
             </pre>
