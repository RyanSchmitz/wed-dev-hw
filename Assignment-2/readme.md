# Assignment 2
<p>A version control system is a tool for developers that allows them to create changes on a document or file with the ability to observe and track these changes throughout the course of its completion. The process of reverting changes in the event that a developer is not pleased with it's result is simple, making VCS a great tool for building the perfect file. We are using this tool in this class because file sharing and collaboration is important, and with a VCS it is made simple.

### Work Cycle
* I'm not going to lie, this assignment was a bit challenging for me. Prior to this course, the only web development experience I had was through a website that gave little control over HTML code. I took this assignment a little bit slow, and had a few issues along the way.
