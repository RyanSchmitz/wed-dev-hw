  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>It is our goal to share recipes with others so that we can all have a collective knowledge on differen't recipes that we love. Food is not just a necessity, but also something that should be treasured and shared. We started our kitchen in 2003 with one goal: to help others learn how to cook. Since our founding, we have helped teach hundreds of beginners how to become excellent cooks through simply sharing recipes.</p>
<br>
  <p>Below is an ispirational video about a cook, which we share weekly on our website.</p>
