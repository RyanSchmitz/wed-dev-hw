## Technical Report
I decided to choose the most familiar (to me) decade for this project. I honestly love everything about 90s, no matter how insane it looks in hindsight. I chose to style my page like a website would look during that time period. Lucky for me, I have little experience with web design, so it sort of happened naturally.

The colors that I used were gold, purple, and pastel pink (HEX CODES: #660066, #ffcc00, #ffccff). I chose them because they went well with the graphic I chose.

This assignment was challenging, and I faced a number of obstacles, and if I'm being honest, I'm not sure if I did everything correctly. The page turned out well, I may have gone alternative routes to achieve something that could have been done a better way.
